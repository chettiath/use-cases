# 2024 Google Cloud - Real World GenAI Use Cases

* Freenome is creating diagnostic tests that will help detect life-threatening diseases like cancer in the earliest, most-treatable stages — combining the latest in science and AI with the ease of a standard blood draw.
* Orby is combining AI and neurotechnology, applying complex mathematical models, Google Cloud’s IT resources, and Gemini to create a “digital brain.” This solution supports patients’ rehabilitation, helping them to recover lost motor skills and reduce their pain.
* AUI's Apollo AI agent empowers businesses to create complex, multi-step conversational experiences for its customers. This neuro-symbolic AI agent integrates with existing systems and tools, ensuring accurate, transparent, and compliant interactions. Apollo is a groundbreaking language model that enables functional conversational agents by replacing the transformer with a neuro-symbolic architecture. This approach relies on obtaining a structured interaction state, created by collecting sensory data to produce a symbolic, parameterized representation of each interaction. By converting unstructured inputs into a structured format, Apollo achieves a higher level of understanding and precision in its responses. The structured interaction state captures contextual nuances - it includes intents, entities, sentiments, and contextual information essential for accurate processing. It also enables advanced reasoning. Each interaction is represented using hundreds of symbolic elements. Apollo utilizes structured entity representations.
* Bayer is building a radiology platform that will assist radiologists with data analysis, intelligent search, and  document creation that meet healthcare requirements needed for regulatory approval. They are also harnessing BigQuery and Vertex AI to develop additional digital medical solutions and drugs more efficiently.
* In 2023, Bayer used TPUs to demonstrate fully quantum mechanical modeling of protein-ligand interactions. Quantum mechanics applied to computer-aided drug discovery enables in-silico modeling of biological & chemical systems with high accuracy, and therefore has the potential to help identify novel drug candidates.  
* Cradle, a biotech startup, is using Google Cloud's generative AI technology to design proteins for drug discovery, food production, and chemical manufacturing. By leveraging TPUs and Google's security infrastructure, the company accelerates R&D processes for pharmaceutical and chemical companies while protecting sensitive intellectual property.
* The U.S. Dept. of Veterans Affairs is using AI at the edge to improve cancer detection for service members and veterans. The Augmented Reality Microscope (ARM) is deployed at remote military treatment facilities around the world. The prototype device is helping pathologists find cancer faster and with better accuracy. The ARM utilizes artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze digitized tissue samples and highlight potential abnormalities.
* Intelligencia AI is using AI models to research novel new drugs, relying on Google Cloud’s AI-optimized infrastructure to deliver scalable research that is accurate and transparent to meet the stringent needs of medicine.
* The Asteroid Institute is using AI to discover hidden asteroids in existing astronomical data. This is a major focus for astronomers researching the evolution of the Solar System, investors and businesses hoping to fly missions to asteroids, and for all who want to prevent future large asteroid impacts on Earth.
* Apollo Hospitals in India partnered with Google Health to build screening models for tuberculosis and breast cancer, helping an extremely limited population of radiologists cover more patients at risk, scaling to 3 million screenings in a matter of years.
* Auransa, an emerging clinical-stage AI-driven biopharma company, has created a proprietary AI platform, SMarTR Engine, to derive a differentiated pipeline of novel drugs. Auransa is dedicated to developing precision medicines in areas of significant unmet need. They use SMarTR Engine to harness available, public and private multi-omics, human disease data to discover novel therapeutics and generate insights from molecular data, providing a deep understanding of disease biology at a subtype resolution. SMarTR Engine is able to find compounds and targets with genomics signatures that "reverse" human disease.
* Ginkgo Bioworks is building a next-generation AI platform for biological engineering and biosecurity, including pioneering new AI models for biological engineering applications that are powered by Vertex AI.
* Superluminal Medicines uses Google Cloud's computing power to analyze multiple protein structures and integrate them into dynamic protein models for drug discovery, allowing for a more accurate representation of protein behavior and the design of more precise drug interventions.
* Jaguar TCS Racing is partnering with Google Cloud to use AI for real-time analysis of race car performance data, giving them a competitive edge in Formula E racing. This collaboration aims to improve its on-track decision-making and help secure the team’s and drivers’ wins and titles.
* McLaren Racing is using Google AI to get up-to-the-millisecond insights during races and training to gain a competitive edge.
